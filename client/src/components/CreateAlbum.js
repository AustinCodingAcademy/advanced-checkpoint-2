// Create a class component that makes a new model (redux fetch practice)
// * Create a form and a button
// * Put a label and an input for each property your model has
// * Bonus - use a drop down if there are a limited number of values for a property
// * Register onChange for each input and use setState to store the information typed in
// * Register onSubmit for the form. 
// * onSubmit call an action called createThing(change it to make sense for your model)
